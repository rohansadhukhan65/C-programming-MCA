    --> preprocessor besically # deke likhne wali lines ko replace 
        karti h code se is # deke likhne wali line ko ham preprosessor
        command bolte h .

    --> after preprocessor's processing it creates a file with .i extension

    --> then compilor compiles .i extension file to .obj file 

    --> now in .obj extension file tehre may some line exist which system
        can't understand and these are defined inside library file 

    --> now another software comes into this compiling processes called
        Linker it linkes all the library file code and creates a new file 
        with .exe extension.

    steps are : 

    1)  1) preprosessor ( includes # started 
        commands in code creates a file with extension .i) 
                    --> 
        2) Compilor (convert .i extension file into .obj file 
        inside this binary codes thakbe)
                    -->
